# pacman
Python Pacman implementation using pygame. 

This is an unfinished pacman written in python using the pygame framework.

## Font
My pacman implementation depends on the excellent free/libre TrueType font "Press Play 2 Start" which
you can download from: http://www.zone38.net/font/pressstart2p.zip
